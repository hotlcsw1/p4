Description:
This is project number four and is intended for us to learn how to interact with MySQL database.  I will showcase inserting, updating and deleting records using PhP, Laravel and Eloquent frameworks.

Details for the teaching team:
No login required

Plugins, libraries, package or outside code:
No, two plugins were used.  I used the loripsum.net API (please see loripsum.net) and Fzaninotto/Faker PHP (please https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker) package.  I used css3buttongenerator.com to help me create a button css, though I did end up updating it later.
